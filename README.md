# Crazy Salad Chef

2D game able to select 1-2 players to create salads with items, which consists of Cabbages, Carrots, Beets, Chicken, Egg and Onion. 2 players is a "couch coop" method.

## Controls
Player One Controls: wads for movement and f for interaction.

Player Two Controls: arrow keys for movement and right ctrl for interaction.

Note: menu uses mouse

## Plans
1) Control menu with keyboard instead of mouse (Selection method)
2) Customer Spawn
4) Game Event to fire at end of time for a score popup.
5) Powerups spawning and use, although the player has bonus speed written inside movement logic.


## Other Notes
I have not finished ending conditions, showing player points and art assets for chicken and egg. Reason for this is that I was sick for two days and it took me a little longer because 2D is different to me, I am more familiar with doing 3D.
