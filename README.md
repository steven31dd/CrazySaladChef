# Crazy Salad Chef

2D game able to select 1-2 players to create salads with items, which consists of Cabbages, Carrots, Beets, Chicken, Egg and Onion. 2 players is a "couch coop" method.

## Controls
Player One Controls: wads for movement and f for interaction.

Player Two Controls: arrow keys for movement and right ctrl for interaction.

Note: menu uses mouse

## Plans
1) game should use gamepad/joystick control
2) Should implement new Input system in the future, but i like the old one :)
3) Menu should use keyboard controls
4) Powerups spawning and use, although the player has bonus speed written inside movement logic.


# Other Notes
I was sick for two days and it took me a little longer because 2D is different to me, I am more familiar with doing 3D.

##What I can do
I should have created a script that keeps track of each button on the menu in a list and highlight/choose one with an index.

##Misc
I think i forgot powerups, even though the logic for speed is there.
